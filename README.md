# TwitterMediaDownloadSync  
Keeps a local folder of twitter artists up to date with their media images, run to keep in sync. [Python2][Mac OS X]  
  
This is, more or less, a modified version of pixivRoot.py.  
For additional help and instructions, please visit that repo [https://github.com/sliceofcake/PixivMediaScraper](https://github.com/sliceofcake/PixivMediaScraper), since that program is basically the same and has a more detailed readme.  
  
Instructions:  
(1) Put twitterRoot.py in some folder on your computer. Navigate to that folder in your Command Line Interface.  
(2) Run it with [python twitterRoot.py]. Since it's your first time doing so, a blank userIDA.txt file will be created in the folder. Fill that file with twitter handles, one per line.  
(3) Run it with [python twitterRoot.py]. Artist folders containing their media files will be created within your main folder.  
(4) Run it anytime in the future to download undownloaded media files.
